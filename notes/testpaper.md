# 🚀 TL;DR


_1-2 sentences summarizing the main contribution. If you revisit this note in 3 years, what is the ONE thing you need to remember?_


## 💡 Key Insight / "The Aha! Moment"


_What is the core novelty? Is it a new loss function? A new architecture? A new way of curating data?_


## 🧐 Problem Statement

- **What are they trying to solve?**
- **Why is it hard?** (e.g., "Previous methods suffered from hallucination because...")
- **What is the gap?** (e.g., "No one has applied RLHF to Thai language models yet.")

## 🛠️ Methodology (The "How")

- **Architecture:** [Brief description, e.g., "Modified LLaMA-3 with sparse attention"]
- **Data:** [e.g., "Pre-trained on 1T tokens of Thai C4 dataset"]
- **Training:** [e.g., "Used LoRA for fine-tuning on 8x A100s"]

## 📊 Results & Evaluation

- **Baselines:** Who did they compare against?
- **Metrics:** What numbers improved? (e.g., "Recall@10 improved by 5%")
- **Ablation Study:** What part of their method actually mattered?

## 💭 My Critique

- **Strengths:**
    - [e.g., "The mathematical proof for convergence is elegant."]
- **Weaknesses/Limitations:**
    - [e.g., "They only tested on English; might not transfer to Thai."]
    - [e.g., "The computational cost is too high for real-time use."]
- **Questions:**
    - [e.g., "Why did they choose $k=5$ for the retrieval step?"]

## 🔮 Future Work / Ideas for Me

- _How can I use this?_
- _Can I apply this method to my NTCIR-19 RegCom project?_
- _Can I replace their backbone with a Thai-specific model?_
